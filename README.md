# Classification-of-Natural-Scenes-using-transfer-learning-CNN
# Introduction:
      This repository contains Files required to reproduce the results image classification of natural images using CNN and transfer learning.

Dataset:
      Dataset used is of natural scenes.This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories
      i.e. Buildings, Forest, Glacier , Mountain, Sea and Street. Dataset is used as
  • Training set = 14k+ 150x150 Images in seg_train folder for training spread.
  • Validation set = 3k+ 150x150 Images in seg_test folder for cross-validation spread.
  • Test set = 7k+ 150x150 Images in seg_pred folder as test spread.
